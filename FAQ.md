# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### About CABIN 2.0

**Q. How "finished" is CABIN?**

Fully playable, but expect more updates to further refine things.

**Q. Where can I download CABIN?**

Stable releases of CABIN can be downloaded from CurseForge using any launcher of your choice (PrismLauncher, CurseForge, etc.)
Bleeding edge builds can be found [here](https://github.com/ThePansmith/CABIN/releases).

**Q. What's the difference between CAB and CABIN**

A comprehensive list of changes can be found on the Curseforge Page.

**Q. Can I port my CAB/CABIN 1.0 world to CABIN 2.0?**

Kinda? Most of the important blocks do exist between versions, so its technically possible. Be warned that various blocks no longer exist or have had their ID's changed, and personally I would recommend just starting anew so you can take full advantage of all the changes CABIN 2.0 brings to the table.  Support will not be offered for anyone attempting to port their worlds.

**Q. Will CABIN be ported to 'X' Minecraft version?**

CABIN will not be backported to any versions before 1.20.1. Porting the pack to a future version of Minecraft may or may not happen, but **do not ask or pester the devs**.

**Q. Will CABIN be ported to Fabric?**

CABIN will not be ported to Fabric.

**Q. Will CABIN be released on Modrinth?**

CABIN is currently not planned to be released on Modrinth. Some mods necessary to the modpack are not available on Modrinth, so releasing on their platform is currently not an option.

**Q. Can I add 'X' mod to my instance of CABIN?**

By default, CABIN only supports the mods included with it, and has *[optional compat](https://github.com/ThePansmith/CABIN/blob/1.20.1/mods/compat.md)* for various mods, such as Enchantment Industry. Any other mods added may break progression and/or deviate from the intended experience. Note that support will not be provided for bugs related to mods not shipped with the pack.

## Tech Support

### Gameplay

**Q. My dynamo isn't outputting energy?**

Thermal Expansion Dynamos will only output energy while producing it.

### Servers

**Q. How do I update CABIN on my server?**

In your server directory delete config-overrides, config, defaultconfig, kubejs, ldlib, and mods. Then from the new CABIN server zip copy over those same directories to replace the ones you removed. Enjoy!
